# mongoScraper

In this assignment, I created a web app that lets users leave comments on the latest news. The app uses mongoose and cheerio muscles to scrape news from the NY Times website. Rules Below:

• Whenever a user visits yoursite, the app will scrape stories from the NY Times. The data includes a link to the story,         headline, and an image.

• The app uses cheerio to grab the site content and mongoose to save it to the mongoDB database.

• All users can leave comments on the stories. They can also delete whatever comments they want removed. All stored comments     are visible to every user. 

• I used mongoose model system to assocaite comments with particular articles.
